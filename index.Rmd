# Instructions {-}

Everything in this course builds up to the term-long group project, where there is
only one learning goal: *Engage in the data/science research pipeline:*

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("static/images/data_science_pipeline.png")
```

Over the course of this project, your group must develop appropriate regression analyses to answer real-world research questions.

In order to break down the task and minimize end-of-semester stress, you'll be working on the project in five phases:

1. [**Project groups:**](#groups) Form groups.
1. [**Project proposal:**](#proposal) Propose a data set for your project and perform an exploratory data analysis. This is the phase of the project that is the least straightforward. Thus, we recommend you start early and get help during office hours and via Piazza early and often. After you submit your proposal, you will get instructor feedback that you should incorporate in your project proposal. 
1. [**Initial submission-video presentation:**](#submission) Make an initial submission of your project (using the material we have covered up to this point in class) in the form of a video presentation created by your group. After you submit your work, you will get peer and instructor feedback that you should incorporate in your final report.
1. [**Peer review of video presentations:**](#peerreview) You will, individually, offer feedback to your classmates' video submissions. 
1. [**Final submission-written report:**](#resubmission) Incorporate your feedback from the initial project submission phase, complete the remaining sections, and resubmit your project. The majority of your grade will come from this final project submission.

During each Project Phase, each student should take on a specific role within the group:

* Facilitator -- Keeps group on task and verifies that all contribute. Makes the submission on behalf of the group. 
* Recorder -- Takes notes on important thoughts expressed in the group. 
* Reporter -- Leads the actual writing of the report.
* Time Keeper -- Monitors time and planning. Monitors if the project is on track. Ensures the work is submitted on time.
* Checker -- Checks for accuracy and clarity of thinking during discussions. Checks written work and tracks points. Ensures the work is submitted on time.

You should take on a different role for each Project Phase.

With each submission, your group will need to report which student completed each role, and your group will report on how much each student contributed. If a particular student contributes less, then they will receive fewer marks. If some group members contribute more, then their grades will be increased correspondingly.

# Project Groups {#groups}

For this Project Phase Submission, you must select a group. You will work with this group throughout the course to complete the Term Project. 

To accomplish this, you must use the "Select Project Groups" group self-selection activity on our Moodle page

* Groups should have 4-5 members each. 
* All groups members are expected to contribute and your grade will be depend on your group's assessment of your individual contributions.
* If you are looking for a group to join, use the "Search for Teammates!" post on Piazza.

# Project Proposal {#proposal}

For the Project Proposal Submission, you must propose a concrete plan for the remainder of the Term Project and find and summarize the data that your group plans to use. Remember that your goal is to develop appropriate regression analyses to answer real-world research questions.


## What to submit

You must download the following  <a href="static/term_project/proposal.Rmd" download>`proposal.Rmd`</a> template R Markdown file and complete it.

`r only_group_leader`

1. The completed `proposal.Rmd` R Markdown file
1. The corresponding `proposal.html` HTML report file
1. If your data is not confidential or sensitive in nature, then publish your data as a CSV file on Google Sheets --  you can do this by following the 6 steps in [this Twitter thread](https://t.co/CeM3IIemFU) (or see [this screenshot of the thread](static/images/Uploading_csv.png)). That way your group can all access a single copy of your data on the web. If your data is confidential or sensitive in nature, do not publish it on the web, but rather submit the Excel or CSV file as well.


You can get a sense for the requirements of this project phase by reading some example project proposals `r submission_will_differ`:

* [Example project proposal 1](static/term_project/pr_example.html){target="_blank"}
* [Example project proposal 2](static/term_project/proposal_example_01.html){target="_blank"}



## Data Requirements

Find a data set that fits the following specifications. Note your data may need a little wrangling from its original form.

### Specifications {-}

Your data must contain

1. (If available) An [identification variable](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#identification-vs-measurement-variables){target="_blank"} that uniquely identifies each observation in each row. 
1. A numerical outcome variable $y$. Note: binary outcomes variables with 0/1 values are not technically numerical.
1. Two explanatory variables:
    + A numerical explanatory variable $x_1$. Note: this can be some notion of time.
    + A categorical explanatory variable $x_2$ that has between 3-5 levels. Note: If your data has more than 5 levels, they can be collapsed into 5 using data wrangling later.
1. At least 50 observations/rows.

### Possible sources {-}

Here are some possible data sources:

* Best option: data from your own research or other courses! The more connected you feel with your data, the more motivated you will be for this project.
* Next best options: Online data repositories such as (but not limited to):
    + [The Government of Canada's Open Data Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data)
    + [IPUMS survey & census data](https://ipums.org/){target="_blank"}

## Hints

* Your data may require some wrangling to get it in the appropriate format. Given that this is not a class where data wrangling is a central focus, we suggest you check out the following resources:

  * the [data wrangling "Tips & Tricks"](https://moderndive.com/C-appendixC.html#data-wrangling){target="_blank"} ModernDive page written by Jenny Smetzer. It's based on the seven most common data wrangling questions they've encountered from students while they were working on their term projects:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("static/images/data_wrangling.png")
```

  * Post questions in Piazza!    
    + Please ask questions that you think the entire class would like to know the answer to in the `project` folder on Piazza; if necessary, you can make the post private. 
  
* Only minimal data wrangling using the `dplyr` package is expected at this time; you will be doing more for the "project proposal" phase coming up. That being said, feel free to experiment!
* Disclaimer: Just because things seem good now doesn't mean your project data is set for semester. Unforeseen problems may crop up during the next phase on data wrangling, at which point you may need to revise your data. This is a reality of data collection in the real world!
* Do not include any `View()` statements in your `.Rmd` files as this may cause an error.
* Avoid "data dumps". For example, showing the contents of all 1000 rows in a data frame. This will make your output document really large and unreadable.

# Initial submission-video presentation: {#submission}


Research cannot be impactful if it is not shared. 
Your task for this assignment is to apply all that you have learned so far in this course to develop appropriate regression analyses to answer your real-world research question.

You must decide as a group how to best explain your key findings. Your research findings will be shared in two ways: 

* a video presentation (this assignment), and
* a written report (the next assignment). 

These two submissions will be form the majority of the marks for your Term Project and should demonstrate your learning from throughout the course.

Your video presentation will be watched and commented on by your classmates. 
In creating your written report (next assignment), you will need to explain what changes you made in response to your own self-reflection and the feedback to your video presentation. 


## What to submit

1. Once your group has created your video presentation (maximum of 7 minutes), you must upload the video to YouTube, Vimeo, Dropbox, or Google Drive and paste a public sharing link as your submission for this assignment.
Your video file must be an MP4, MPEG, or Ogg video file (in order to be compatible with Perusall). 
2. In addition, you must submit a statement of the roles and contributions of each individual to this group project:
  + Describe the role (Facilitator, Recorder, Reporter, Time Keeper, Checker) and level of contribution of each group member during this project phase
  + If your group were to earn 5 points on this submission, how should those points be shared across your group members?

When presenting your work, you must ensure that you clearly present each of the following:

* Statement of the problem: Describe the questions you address and any key issues surrounding the questions. Present your original research hypotheses (i.e., what you initially thought you would find by looking at these data)
* Data collection: Explain where the data came from and any implications of the process by which the data were collected.
* Analyses: Describe the analyses you did. 
* Results: Present relevant descriptive and inferential statistics. Include tables or graphs that support your findings (be judicious: too many tables and graphs will hurt the clarity of your message). 
* Conclusions: Answer your questions of interest in context. Appropriately applied and interpreted regression analyses will be the key aspect of the marking of your project.
* Discussion: What implications do your results have? and for what population?  What could be done to improve the study if it was done again? What types of biases might exist?


## Hints

* Your group can meet (and present) together in Blackboard Collaborate by clicking the "Group Meeting room" link on our class's Moodle page. If you wish, you could then create a breakout group where you can share your visuals and use screen recording software to record yourselves presenting your material.
* Other good options for recording your screen and audio include Quicktime (if you are using a mac), Screencast-O-Matic, or Camtasia. 
* Your group could also meet and record yourselves via Zoom, Skype, Google Meet, etc. You can call in to Zoom and Google Meet with a landline, so these should be an option as well even if you don't have a microphone on your computer.

# Peer review of video presentations: {#peerreview} 

You will be assigned several of your classmates' video submissions to (individually) peer review. 
You will watch the presentations assigned to you and offer comments and constructive feedback to your classmates' video submissions. 
This will be an important opportunity to view the work being done by other groups in your class and, through your constructive feedback, to apply your growing understanding of the course material to a new research question.

## What to submit

These peer review assignments will be visible on your Moodle page after the presentations have all been submitted. 

The assignment links in Moodle will take you to Perusall.com, where you will be able to view and annotate the assigned videos. 
You will be graded based on your participation (completely watching the videos) and on the quality of your feedback. 


*******


# Final Project Submission {#resubmission}

The goal of this assignment is to perform create a final written report (maximum of 7 pages) for your group project.

When presenting your work, you must ensure that you clearly present each of the following:

* Statement of the problem: Describe the questions you address and any key issues surrounding the questions. Present your original research hypotheses (i.e., what you initially thought you would find by looking at these data)
* Data collection: Explain where the data came from and any implications of the process by which the data were collected.
* Analyses: Describe the analyses you did. 
* Results: Present relevant descriptive and inferential statistics. Include tables or graphs that support your findings (be judicious: too many tables and graphs will hurt the clarity of your message). 
* Conclusions: Answer your questions of interest in context. Appropriately applied and interpreted regression analyses will be the key aspect of the marking of your project.
* Discussion: What implications do your results have? and for what population?  What could be done to improve the study if it was done again? What types of biases might exist?



## What to submit

`r only_group_leader`

1. An R Markdown file containing your reproducible report file.
1. The corresponding knitted HTML report file.
1. Only if your data is confidential or sensitive in nature, submit your Excel or CSV file as well. Otherwise you should publish your data as a CSV file on Google Sheets as described above.
1. A statement of the roles and contributions of each individual to this group project:
  + Describe the role (Facilitator, Recorder, Reporter, Time Keeper, Checker) and level of contribution of each group member during this project phase
  + If your group were to earn 5 points on this submission, how should those points be shared across your group members?
