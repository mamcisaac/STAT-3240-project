### Learning Objectives for Sections 2.1-2.3

After Sections 2.1-2.3, you should be able to 

* Compute and interpret **confidence intervals** for `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`
* Conduct and interpret **hypothesis tests** concerning `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`
* Define **power** and explain how it impacts inference


---

### 2: Inferences in Regression and Correlation Analysis
We assume that the *normal error regression model* is applicable: 
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i
$$

* `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)` are parameters
* `\(X_i\)` are known constants
* `\(\varepsilon_i\)` are independent `\(N(0, \sigma^2)\)`. 




---

### 2.1. Inferences Concerning `\(\beta_1\)`

At times, tests concerning `\(\beta_1\)` are of interest, particularly one of the form

`$$H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \qquad vs \qquad H_a: \beta_1\neq 0$$`


---

### 2.1. Inferences Concerning `\(\beta_1\)`

If we assume that
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i, \quad \text{ with } E[\varepsilon_i]=0,
$$
then `\(E[Y] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X\)`. `\(\qquad\)`
Thus, `\(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\)` is equivalent to 
`$$H_0: E[Y] = \beta_0,$$`
so the null hypothesis is equivalent to
`$$H_0: \text{There is no linear association between Y and X}$$`

---

### 2.1. Inferences Concerning `\(\beta_1\)`

When we make the stronger assumption of the *normal error regression model*: 
`$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i +  \varepsilon_i \text{ with } \varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2),$$`
then `\(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\)` is actually equivalent to the stronger statement that
`$$H_0: Y_i = \beta_0 + \varepsilon_i, \text{ where } \varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$`
i.e.
`$$H_0: \text{There is no relation of any type between Y and X}$$`


---

### Sampling Distribution of `\(b_1\)`

`\(\beta_1\)` can be estimated in a given sample by
`$$b_1 = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2}$$`

Every sample would result in a different **point estimate** `\(b_1\)` even if the *predictor variables*, `\(X\)`, were held constant across samples. 

--

Under the *normal error regression model* ( `\(Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i +  \varepsilon_i\)` with `\(\varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)`), 
the **sampling distribution** of the *estimator* `\(b_1\)` is 

`$$b_1 \sim N ( \beta_1, \ \sigma \{ b_1 \} ), \qquad  \text{ with }\  \sigma^2 \{ b_1 \}  = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum (X_i - \bar X)^2}$$`

Therefore, 
`$$\frac{b_1 - \beta_1}{\sigma \{ b_1 \} } \sim N ( 0, 1 ).$$`

---

### Sampling Distribution of `\(b_1\)` with `\(\sigma \{ b_1 \}\)` unknown

When `\(\sigma \{ b_1 \}\)`, is estimated by `\(s \{ b_1 \}\)`, we rely on
`$$\frac{b_1 - \beta_1}{s \{ b_1 \} } \sim t(n-2), \qquad \text{ where } s^2 \{ b_1 \}  = \frac{MSE}{\sum (X_i - \bar X)^2}$$`

*Note: There are `\(n\)` unique pieces of data, but 2 parameters are estimated in the regression model ( `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`), so there are `\(n-2\)` **degrees of freedom**.*


---

### Confidence Interval for `\(\beta_1\)`

The `\(1-\alpha\)` confidence limits for `\(\beta_1\)` are 
`\(\boxed{b_1 \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)s \{ b_1 \}  }.\)`

### Data Set for Warm Up Questions: SHS

The Canadian Survey of Household Spending is carried out annually across Canada. 

(http://dli-idd-nesstar.statcan.gc.ca.proxy.library.upei.ca/webview/) 

The main purpose of the survey is to obtain detailed information about household spending. Information is also collected about dwelling characteristics as well as household equipment. 

The survey data are used by the following groups:

* Government departments use the data to help formulate policy; 
* Community groups, social agencies and consumer groups use the data to support their positions and to lobby governments for social changes; 
* Lawyers and their clients use the data to determine what is fair for child support and other compensation; 
* Labour and contract negotiators rely on the data when discussing wage and cost-of-living clauses; 
* Individuals and families can use the data to compare their spending habits with those of similar types of households.

&lt;!-- PUT SELECT WARM UP RESPONSES HEREHERE (preceded by a "&gt;"): --&gt;
&lt;!-- warm up question 2a) 1 --&gt;

* We are 95% confident that the mean of clothing expenditures increases by an amount found between -0.00000 and 0.06099 for each additional unit in income. However, we cannot speak about spending a negative amount of money, so that would be extrapolating, so it is more reasonable to not interpret the negative part of the CI.

* There is a 95% chance that `\(\beta_1\)` would fall in the interval (-0.0331, 0.06430)

* If we replicated the same study multiple times with different random samples and computed a confidence interval for each sample, we would expect 95% of the confidence intervals to say that there is no significant relationship between income and clothing expenditure.

* It is hard to interpret since 0 lays inside the interval.

### Tests Concerning `\(\beta_1\)`

Since 
`$$\frac{b_1 - \beta_1}{s \{ b_1 \} } \sim t(n-2),$$`
tests concering `\(\beta_1\)` can be set up in ordinary fashion using the `\(t\)` distribution. 

--

I.e., if `\(\beta_1=0\)`, then `\(\frac{b_1 - 0}{s \{ b_1 \} } \sim t(n-2).\)`

So, we can test whether `\(\beta_1=0\)` by looking at whether 
`$$t^\ast=\frac{b_1}{s \{ b_1 \} }$$`
looks like it comes from a `\(t(n-2)\)` distribution. 

--

* `\(p\)`-value is the probability that we would get an estimate of `\(\beta_1\)` that as far from 0 as the one that we saw, **if `\(\beta_1=0\)`**. 
* `\(p\)`-value `\(= P\left(  \left| \frac{b_1 - \beta_1}{s \{ b_1 \} } \right| &gt; | t^\ast | | \beta_1 = 0 \right) = P (  | t(n-2) | &gt; |t^\ast| )\)`

---


Remember that the `\(p\)`-value is **the probability that we would see something as *extreme* as what we saw ( `\(t^\ast\)`) if the null hypothesis were true**. 

--

"Extreme" is defined by the alternate hypothesis: 

* `\(H_a: \beta_1 &gt;0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad p^\ast{=}P (  t_{n-2} &gt; t^\ast )\)` 
* `\(H_a: \beta_1 &lt; 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad p^\ast{=}P (  t_{n-2} &lt; t^\ast )\)` 
* `\(H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad p^\ast{=}P (  t_{n-2} &gt; |t^\ast| \text{ or } t_{n-2} &lt; -|t^\ast|) {=}P (  |t_{n-2}| &gt; |t^\ast|)\)`

* At a 95% confidence level, it can not be concluded that clothing expenditure and income are related. This is because a slope of zero is in the confidence interval, thus it is possible that the slope is zero indicating no relationship. Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
* No, because we failed to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore the slope may not be effected by the relation of clothing expenditure and income.
* Since we fail to reject the null hypothesis and ß1 = 0 , the clothing expenditure is not related to income.
* It could be no relationship between clothing expenditure and income. Because the B1 could equal =0,

### SHS: Thinking about Power
* **Explain in your own words the concept of power. Do you believe that we have a lot of power in this setting?**


&lt;!-- PUT SELECT WARM UP RESPONSES HEREHERE (preceded by a "&gt;"): --&gt;
&lt;!-- warm up question 2a) 3 --&gt;

* Power is the probability of avoiding a type 2 error when conducting a test. (Type 2 error is when the null hypothesis should be rejected, but we do not reject it). So, it is the probability that we reject the null hypothesis and reach to the conclusion of the alternate hypothesis, when the null hypothesis was indeed false and the alternate hypothesis truly holds. 

* power refers to the ability to reject a null hypothesis when it is false. That is, we make the correct decision in rejecting the null hypothesis. This test uses a high sample size (using data from across Canada).

&lt;!-- PUT SELECT WARM UP RESPONSES HEREHERE (preceded by a "&gt;"): --&gt;
&lt;!-- warm up question 2a) 3 --&gt;

* Power is the probability that a false null hypothesis will be rejected. Since alpha (the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis) is low (0.05) power is also low. This is because when everything else is kept constant, as alpha increases so does power. This is because a larger alpha increases the chances of rejecting a true null hypothesis and thus a false null hypothesis.

* Power is a quantity that measures how well the test's ability in detecting a false null hypothesis is. I don't think we have a lot of power in this setting for the sample size is relatively small (n =30).

* Yes, I think that we have a lot of power because B1 is not equal to 0.

&lt;!-- warm up question 2a) 3 --&gt;

* The power shows how high probability there is to make a correct conclusion, e.g. reject the null hypothesis when it is false. I would say that our test does not have a lot of power since we can not come to a conclusion whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

* Power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis

* There is no power in this setting because we failed to reject the null hypothesis.

* power is the likelihood that the conclusion drawn from an analysis reflects the truth

### Recap: Sections 2.1-2.3

After Sections 2.1-2.3, you should be able to 

* Compute and interpret **confidence intervals** for `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`
* Conduct and interpret **hypothesis tests** concerning `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`
* Define **power** and explain how it impacts inference

### Learning Objectives for Sections 2.4-2.6

After Sections 2.4-2.6, you should be able to 

* Compute and interpret **confidence intervals for `\(E[Y]\)`**
* Compute and interpret **prediction intervals** for a new observation
* Compute and interpret **confidence bands** for a regression line

### 2.4 Interval Estimation of `\(E[Y_h]\)`

A common objective in regression analysis is to estimate the mean for one or more probability distributions of `\(Y\)`. 

Consider a study of the relation between the level of piecework pay ( `\(X\)`) and worker productivity ( `\(Y\)`). 

The mean productivity at high and medium levels of piecework pay may be of particular interest. Why? 


---

### Sampling Distribution of `\(\hat{Y}_h\)`

`\(E[Y_h]\)`, the mean response when `\(X=X_h\)`, can be estimated in a given sample by 
`$$\boxed{\hat{Y}_h = b_0 + b_1 X_h}$$`

Every sample would result in a different **point estimate** `\(\hat{Y}_h\)` even if the *predictor variables*, `\(X\)`, were held constant across samples. 

--

Under the *normal error regression model* ( `\(Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i +  \varepsilon_i\)` with `\(\varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)`), 
the **sampling distribution** of the *estimator* `\(\hat{Y}_h\)` is 

$$
`\begin{align*}
\hat{Y}_h &amp; \sim N ( E[\hat{Y}_h], \ \sigma \{ \hat{Y}_h \} ), \\
\text{ with }\ E[\hat{Y}_h] &amp;= E[b_0 + b_1 X_h] = E[b_0] + E[b_1] X_h = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_h \\
\text{ and } \sigma \{ \hat{Y}_h \}  &amp; = \sigma^2 \left[\frac{1}{n} +  \frac{(X_h - \bar X)^2}{\sum (X_i - \bar X)^2} \right] 
\end{align*}`
$$

---
### Sampling Distribution of `\(\hat{Y}_h\)` when `\(\sigma^2\)` is unknown

Therefore, when `\(\sigma^2\)` is unknown, the `\(1-\alpha\)` confidence limits for `\(E[Y_h]\)` are
`$$\boxed{\hat{Y}_h \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)s \{ \hat{Y}_h \}  }, \qquad \text{ where } s^2 \{ \hat{Y}_h \}  = MSE \left[\frac{1}{n} +  \frac{(X_h - \bar X)^2}{\sum (X_i - \bar X)^2} \right]$$`

### SHS: Interval Estimation of `\(\hat{Y}_h\)`


A 90% confidence interval for `\(E[Y_h]\)` corresponding to `\(X_h = 60000\)` can be found using the following code in `R`:

```r
ci = predict(clothing_model, newdata=data.frame(income=60000), interval="confidence", level=.90)

ci 
```

```
##        fit      lwr      upr
## 1 2893.476 2204.008 3582.944

```

* **In your own words, interpret what the given 90% confidence interval for `\(E[Y_h]\)` corresponding to `\(X_h = 60000\)` actually means in the context of the problem.**

* We are 90% confident that the mean clothing expenditure, when 60000 Canadian Dollars is the income, is somewhere between 2204.00784 and 3582.944245 Canadian Dollars for clothing expenditure.

* I have 90% of confidence to say that the mean expenditure on clothing of the Canadians at the income level of 60000 fall in the interval (2704.00784,3582.944245).

### 2.6 Confidence Band for Regression Line

--

* **If two confidence intervals each *independently* have a 90% chance of containing the true mean response at different levels of `\(X_h\)`, then what is the probability that they both
*simultaneously* capture the true mean responses? **

--

These *pointwise* 90% confidence intervals are *simultaneous* ____% confidence intervals. 

--

Therefore, if we want to obtain a  **confidence band** (i.e., *simultaneous confidence intervals*) for the entire regression line `\(E[Y] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X\)`, then we need to make each interval wider. 

---

* If we wanted to capture two points simultaneously, we might use the **Bonferroni** method and consider `\(100\cdot(1-\alpha/2)\)`% pointwise confidence intervals `\((.95 \cdot .95 \approx .90)\)`.  

--

* Similarly, if we wanted to capture three points simultaneously, we might use the Bonferroni method and consider `\(100\cdot(1-\alpha/3)\)`%  pointwise confidence intervals `\((.966 \cdot .966 \cdot .966 \approx .90)\)`.

--

* Similarly, for four points, we could use `\(100\cdot(1-\alpha/4)\)`% pointwise confidence intervals `\((.975 \cdot .975 \cdot .975 \cdot .975 \approx .90)\)`. 

--

* However, this approach is conservative, and as the number of points grows, the Bonferroni method produces unreasonably wide intervals

--

Consider how wide the *confidence band* produced by the Bonferroni method would be. 

---

One appropriate choice for *simultaneously capturing the regression line at all values `\(X_h\)`* is the Working-Hotelling confidence limits:
`$$\boxed{\hat{Y}_h \pm \color{red}{\sqrt{2 F(1-\alpha; 2; n-2)}} s \{ \hat{Y}_h \}  }$$`
where, again, 
`$$s^2 \{ \hat{Y}_h \}  = MSE \left[\frac{1}{n} +  \frac{(X_h - \bar X)^2}{\sum (X_i - \bar X)^2} \right]$$`

Notice that this is the same confidence interval that we are used to, but `\(t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)\)` is replaced with the (often only slightly) larger `\(\sqrt{2 F(1-\alpha; 2; n-2)}\)`. 

--- 

`\(F(1-\alpha; 2; n-2)\)` represents the `\(100 \cdot (1-\alpha)\)` percentile of an `\(F\)` distribution with `\(2\)` and `\(n-2\)` degrees of freedom. We will discuss the `\(F\)` distribution more as the class progresses.

### 2.5 Prediction of New Observation

So far, we have been concerned with capturing the *mean response* `\(E[Y_h]\)` corresponding to a given level `\(X_h\)` of the predictor variable. 

We now consider the prediction of a *new observation `\(Y\)`* corresponding to a given level `\(X_h\)` of the predictor variable. 

--

Remember that `\(Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i,\)`  where `\(\varepsilon_i\)` are independent `\(N(0, \sigma^2).\)`

Therefore, if we knew `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`, we would expect new observations to satisfy
`$$Y_h \sim N(E[Y_h], \ \sigma^2), \qquad \text{ where } E[Y_h] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_h.$$`

--

Thus a reasonable prediction interval for `\(Y_h\)` would be 
`$$E[Y_h] \ \pm \ z(1-\alpha/2) \sigma,$$`
where `\(z(1-\alpha/2)\)` is the `\(100\cdot(1-\alpha/2)\)`th percentile of the standard normal distribution.

This prediction interval should capture about `\(100(1-\alpha)\)`% of new observations at `\(X_h\)`. 


---

### Prediction of New Observation When Parameters are Unknown

However, when `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)` are not known, we don't know `\(E[Y_h]\)`, so we can't use 
`$$E[Y_h] \ \pm \ z(1-\alpha/2) \sigma.$$`
Additionally, we don't know `\(\sigma.\)`

--

Instead, we need to centre our interval at `\(\hat{Y}_h\)` and we need to account for the additional uncertainty that comes from using estimates:
`$$\boxed{\hat{Y}_h \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)s \{ pred \}  },  \qquad \text{ where } s^2 \{ pred \}  = MSE + s^2 \{ \hat{Y}_h \}$$`

`$$\color{blue}{\hat{Y}_h \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)s \{ \hat{Y}_h \}  }, \qquad \text{ where } s^2 \{ \hat{Y}_h \}  = MSE \left[\frac{1}{n} +  \frac{(X_h - \bar X)^2}{\sum (X_i - \bar X)^2} \right]$$`

The corresponding (pointwise) prediction intervals would be of the form
`$${\hat{Y}_h \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)s \{ pred \}  },  \qquad \text{ where } s^2 \{ pred \}  = MSE + s^2 \{ \hat{Y}_h \}$$`

&lt;!-- warm up question 2a) 5 --&gt;

* The CI, previously mentioned, represents an inference on the mean clothing expenditure, when 6000 Canadian Dollars is the income... However, the corresponding prediction interval is a statement about what the value of the clothing expenditure would be in the next survey taken, if 6000 where the income. 

* Prediction intervals must account for both the uncertainty in knowing the value of the population mean, plus data scatter, so it would always be wider. A prediction interval of Y of level X = 6000 says that the next time we pick somebody whose income is 6000, his/her clothing expenditure with most likely be within the prediction interval.

* The 90% prediction interval would be wider than the 90% confidence interval... In this case the prediction interval is (1605.15465,4181.79744). This indicates that there is a 90% chance that someone that makes `$`60000 a year is going to spend between `$`1605.15465 and `$`4181.79744 on clothes in a year.

### Prediction of Mean of `\(m\)` New Observations for Given `\(X_h\)`

Occasionally, one would like to predict the mean of `\(m\)` new observations for `\(Y\)` for `\(X_h\)`, a given level of the predictor variable.

The appropriate `\(1-\alpha\)` prediction limits are as follows, assuming the new `\(Y\)` observations are independent:
`$$\boxed{\hat{Y}_h \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)s \{ predmean \}  }$$`
where `\(\boxed{s^2 \{ predmean \}  = \frac{MSE}{m} + s^2 \{ \hat{Y}_h \}}.\)`


--

Contrast this with the prediction interval for a single observation:
`$${\hat{Y}_h \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)s \{ pred \}  },  \qquad \text{ where } s^2 \{ pred \}  = MSE + s^2 \{ \hat{Y}_h \}$$`

Note that we have just as much uncertainty surrounding our estimate of where the prediction interval should be centered ( `\(s^2 \{ \hat{Y}_h \}\)`), but the variation in the distribution of `\(\bar{Y_h}\)` for `\(m\)` individuals ( `\(\frac{MSE}{m}\)`) is smaller than the variation in the distribution of a single point `\(Y_h\)` ( `\(MSE\)`).

### 2.7: Analysis of Variance Approach to Regression Analysis

We have developed the basic regression model and demonstrated is major uses. 

We now consider the regression analysis from the perspective of **analysis of variance**. 

This new perspective will not enable us to do anything new, but the analysis of variance approach will come into its own when we take up multiple regression models and other types of linear statistical models. 

---

### Partitioning of Total Sum of Squares

The analysis of variance (**ANOVA**) approach is based on the partitioning of sums of squares and degrees of freedom associated with the response variable `\(Y\)`

Y_i - \bar Y = &amp; \color{blue}{\hat Y_i - \bar Y} + \color{red}{Y_i - \hat Y_i} \\

* **What happens to the regression sum of squares if the true regression line is horizontal (i.e., if `\(\beta_1=0\)`)?**




&lt;img src="chapter2_files/figure-html/anova plot 0-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---


`$$\begin{align*}
\sum(Y_i - \bar Y)^2 &amp; = \color{blue}{\sum(\hat Y_i - \bar Y)^2} + \color{red}{\sum(Y_i - \hat Y_i)^2} \\
\text{total sum of squares} &amp; = \color{blue}{\text{regression sum of squares}} + \color{red}{\text{error sum of squares}} \\
SSTO &amp; = \color{blue}{SSR} + \color{red}{SSE} \\
\end{align*}$$`


* **What happens to the regression sum of squares if the regression line is far from horizontal (e.g., if `\(\beta_1&gt; &gt;0\)`)?**



&lt;img src="chapter2_files/figure-html/anova plot big-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Note that `\(SSR\)` is thus a measure of how far `\(\beta_1\)` is from 0. 
* However, whether a specific `\(SSR\)` is "big" or "small" depends on the setting; we need to consider the relative size of `\(SSR\)` to `\(SSE\)` in order to determine whether `\(\beta_1\)` appears to be significantly different from 0. 
* Note also that `\(\frac{SSR}{SSTO}\)` is a measure of how much of the variability in `\(Y\)` is explained by the linear model.

### `\(F\)` Test of `\(\beta_1=0\)` versus `\(\beta_1 \neq 0\)`

The analysis of variance approach provides us with a battery of highly useful tests for regression models. 

For the simple linear regression case considered here, we can use the *test statistic* `\(F^\ast=\frac{MSR}{MSE}\)` to test 
`$$H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \qquad vs \qquad H_a: \beta_1\neq 0 .$$`

* If `\(H_0\)` is true, then `\(F^\ast\)` should be close to `\(1\)`.
* If `\(H_a\)` is true, then `\(F^\ast\)` should be much bigger than `\(1\)`.
 
---

### Sampling Distribution of `\(F^\ast\)`
In order to develop a test, we need to be more precise than * `\(F^\ast\)` should be close to `\(1\)`.*

By Cochran's theorem, `\(\text{when } H_0 \text{ holds}\)`
`$$F^\ast  = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = \frac{\frac{SSR}{\sigma^2}}{1} \div \frac{\frac{SSE}{\sigma^2}}{n-2} \sim \frac{\chi^2(1)}{1} \div \frac{\chi^2(n-2)}{n-2},$$`
where the `\(\chi^2\)` variables are independent. 

--

I.e., 
`$$\boxed{ 
F^\ast  \sim F(1, n-2) \qquad \text{when } H_0 \text{ holds}  
} \qquad (\text{i.e., when } \beta_1=0)$$`

--

When `\(H_0\)` does not hold (i.e., when `\(\beta_1 \neq 0\)`), `\(F^\ast\)` follows the non-central `\(F\)` distribution. 
* The important thing is that it will tend to be bigger than `\(1\)` 
  + how much bigger depends on what `\(\beta_1\)` actually equals.

### SHS: ANOVA

The Canadian Survey of Household Spending is carried out annually across Canada. 

(http://dli-idd-nesstar.statcan.gc.ca.proxy.library.upei.ca/webview/) 

The main purpose of the survey is to obtain detailed information about household spending. Information is also collected about dwelling characteristics as well as household equipment. 

The survey data are used by the following groups:

* Government departments use the data to help formulate policy; 
* Community groups, social agencies and consumer groups use the data to support their positions and to lobby governments for social changes; 
* Lawyers and their clients use the data to determine what is fair for child support and other compensation; 
* Labour and contract negotiators rely on the data when discussing wage and cost-of-living clauses; 
* Individuals and families can use the data to compare their spending habits with those of similar types of households.

We are interested in the potential relationship between the income of working Canadians and the amount that they spend on clothing in a year.

* The p-value is the probability of obtaining a result at least this extreme, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

* The small p-value allows us to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relation between clothing expenditure and income (b1 =0)

* The p-value is 4.174e-07 . Therefore, at a significance level of 0.01 the null hypothesis (income and amount spent on clothes are not related) can be rejected and it can be concluded that income and amount spent on clothing are related in a statistically significant way.

* we have to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that B1 is different than 0. Thus, there is a linear relationship between mean clothing expenditures and income.

&lt;!-- PUT SELECT WARM UP RESPONSES HEREHERE (preceded by a "&gt;"): --&gt;
&lt;!-- warm up question 2b) 1 --&gt;

* With such a small p-value it means we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the variances of clothes expenditure and income are not effected by each other.

* p value is the probability for the b1 of the sample to be true given that the beta1 = 0 is true. It is the probability for income and expenditure to have linear association. if the p value is too small, then there is no linear association between income and expenditure.

*  P value shows that there is a very low probability to get the results we assumed in our null hypothesis, therefore showing there isn't a strong relationship between income and clothing expenditure
 

* The p-value shows the probability that our null hypothesis is true, which would be that there is no relationship between income and how much they spend on clothing. The p-value is a very small number in this case, hence there is a very low probability that there is no relationship between income and clothing expenditures.
* At 0.0000004174 we reject the null hypothesis as the probability of a Type 2 error is so low.

### Equivalence of `\(F\)`-test and two-sided `\(T\)`-test

`$$\begin{align*}
	F^\ast &amp; = \frac{MSR}{MSE} \\
		&amp;= 	\frac{b_1^2 \sum (X_i - \bar X)^2}{MSE} \\
		&amp;= 	\frac{b_1^2}{s^2 \{ b_1 \} } \\
		&amp;= 	\left(\frac{b_1}{s \{ b_1 \} } \right)^2 \\
		&amp;= 	\left( t^\ast \right)^2 \\
\end{align*}$$`

In addition, 
`$$F( 1 - \alpha; 1; n-2) = t( 1 - \alpha/2; n-2)^2$$`

--

**For simple linear regression**, these are equivalent tests of `\(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\)`.

* Construct and interpret an ANOVA table 
* Conduct and interpret an ANOVA F test

### Learning Objectives for Sections 2.8-2.10

After Sections 2.8-2.10, you should be able to 

* Describe the general linear test approach
* Calculate and interpret `\(R^2\)`
* Understand the limitations of `\(R^2\)`
* Describe the limitations of linear regression analysis	

---

### 2.8: General Linear Test Approach

The test of `\(\beta_1 = 0\)` versus `\(\beta_1 \neq 0\)` is a simple example of a general linear test.

The general linear test can be used in a wide variety of situations (some complex and some, like here, are simple) and has three parts

* Full Model
* Reduced Model
* Test Statistic

It tests whether the reduced model is "adequate". 

That is, it tests whether the full model is significantly better than the reduced model at explaining the variability in the response.

---

### Full Model 

A full linear model is first fit to the data. 

Then, the *error sum of squares* is obtained for this "full" model (** `\(SSE(F)\)`**). 

In the context of simple linear regression, the full model is 
`$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i$$`
and the error sum of squares for this model is
`$$SSE(F) = \sum [Y_i − (b_0 + b_1 X_i)]^2 = \sum (Y_i − \hat Y_i)^2 = SSE.$$`

Notice that for this full model, the error sum of squares is simply *SSE*, which measures the variability of `\(Y_i\)` observations around the fitted regression line.

---

### Reduced Model

A reduced model is then fit to the data. 

Here, we are considering a "reduced" simple linear regression model where the slope is zero (i.e., there is no relationship between input and output):

`$$H_0 : \beta_1 = 0 \qquad \text{ vs } H_a : \beta_1 \neq 0$$`

The model when `\(H_0\)` holds is called the reduced or restricted model. Here, it corresponds to the model 
`$$Y_i = \beta_0^\ast + \varepsilon_i$$`

--

To develop the test statistic, we also need the *error sum of squares* for the reduced model:

`$$SSE(R) = \sum [Y_i − b_0^\ast]^2 = \sum (Y_i − \bar Y_i)^2 = SSTO.$$`

---

### Test Statistic 

The idea is to compare the two error sums of squares SSE(F) and SSE(R).

Note that we aren't just looking for which is bigger. 
Because the full model has more parameters than the reduced model, it is always true that
`$$SSE(F) \leq SSE(R)$$`

--

The question is whether `\(SSE(F)\)` is *sufficiently* smaller than `\(SSE(R)\)` to justify the additional parameters.

* I.e., the *full* model will always fit the data better than the *reduced* model, but is the fit *significantly* better?

---

In the general linear test, the test statistic is
`$$\boxed{F^\ast = \frac{SSE(R)−SSE(F)}{df_R−df_F} \div \frac{SSE(F)}{df_F}}$$`
which follows the `\(F\)` distribution when `\(H_0\)` holds.

The degrees of freedom `\(df_R\)` and `\(df_F\)` are those associated with the reduced and full model error sums of squares respectively.

The decision rule is, therefore, based on whether `\(\boxed{F^\ast &gt; F(1-\alpha; df_R - df_F, df_F)}\)`; this would be evidence against `\(H_0\)`. 


---

For testing whether or not `\(\beta_1=0\)`, we therefore have 

* `\(SSE(F) = SSE\)`
* `\(SSE(R) = SSTO\)`
* `\(df_F = n-2\)`
* `\(df_R = n-1\)`

So, 
`$$\boxed{F^\ast = \frac{SSTO−SSE}{1} \div \frac{SSE}{n-2}  = \frac{SSR}{1} \div \frac{SSE}{n-2} = \frac{MSR}{MSE}},$$`
which is identical to the ANOVA test statistic.

### SHS: General Linear Test Approach

The Canadian Survey of Household Spending is carried out annually across Canada. 

(http://dli-idd-nesstar.statcan.gc.ca.proxy.library.upei.ca/webview/) 

The main purpose of the survey is to obtain detailed information about household spending. Information is also collected about dwelling characteristics as well as household equipment. 

The survey data are used by the following groups:

* Government departments use the data to help formulate policy; 
* Community groups, social agencies and consumer groups use the data to support their positions and to lobby governments for social changes; 
* Lawyers and their clients use the data to determine what is fair for child support and other compensation; 
* Labour and contract negotiators rely on the data when discussing wage and cost-of-living clauses; 
* Individuals and families can use the data to compare their spending habits with those of similar types of households.

* In the general linear test approach we know that SSE(R) is greater or equal to SSE(F). If they are equal or close to it, we know that the addition of the parameters in full models do not significantly reduce the variations around the fitted regression model. In this example and with the value of the CD at 0.05(approx), we can conclude that the predictor variable is not a significant factor in reducing the total variation.
* In the General linear test approach we compare the SSE and the SSTO, if those values are relatively close to each other it is more likely that the null hypothesis holds. In our test there is not so big difference between those numbers.which would indicate that our null hypothesis may hold.

### 2.9: Descriptive Measures of Linear Association between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`. 

* `\(SSTO\)` measures the variation in the observations `\(Y_i\)` when `\(X\)` is not considered
* `\(SSE\)` measures the variation in the `\(Y_i\)` after a predictor variable `\(X\)` is employed
* A natural measure of the effect of `\(X\)` in reducing variation in `\(Y\)` is to express the reduction in variation `\((SSTO − SSE = SSR)\)` as a proportion of the total variation: 
`$$R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SSTO} = 1 − \frac{SSE}{SSTO}$$`

--

`\(R^2\)` is called the **Coefficient of Determination**. 

Note that since `\(0 \leq SSE \leq SSTO\)` then `\(0 \leq R^2 \leq 1.\)`

--

1. When all observations fall on the fitted regression line, `\(SSE =0\)` and `\(R^2=1\)`

--

2. When the fitted regression line is horizontal so that `\(b_1=0\)` and `\(\hat Y_i = \bar Y\)`, then `\(SSE=SSTO\)` and `\(R^2=0\)`.




---

### Misunderstandings about `\(R^2\)`

* high `\(R^2\)` indicates that useful predictions can be made.   
    + The prediction interval for a particular input of interest may still be wide even if `\(R^2\)` is high.

--

* high `\(R^2\)` means that there is a good linear fit between predictor and outcome.  
    + It can be the case that an approximate (bad) linear fit to a truly curvilinear relationship might result in a high `\(R^2\)`.

--

* low `\(R^2\)` means that there is no relationship between predictor and outcome.  
    + Also not true since there can be clear and strong relationships between predictor and outcome that are not well explained by a linear functional relationship.


---

### Coefficient of Correlation

`$$\boxed{
r = \pm \sqrt{R^2}
}$$`

* If `\(b_1 &gt;0\)`, then `\(r = \sqrt{R^2}\)`
* If `\(b_1 &lt; 0\)`, then `\(r = -\sqrt{R^2}\)`

`$$-1 \leq r \leq 1.$$`

* We will discuss this more in Section 2.11

### SHS: Coefficient of Determination

The Canadian Survey of Household Spending is carried out annually across Canada. 

(http://dli-idd-nesstar.statcan.gc.ca.proxy.library.upei.ca/webview/) 

The main purpose of the survey is to obtain detailed information about household spending. Information is also collected about dwelling characteristics as well as household equipment. 

The survey data are used by the following groups:

* Government departments use the data to help formulate policy; 
* Community groups, social agencies and consumer groups use the data to support their positions and to lobby governments for social changes; 
* Lawyers and their clients use the data to determine what is fair for child support and other compensation; 
* Labour and contract negotiators rely on the data when discussing wage and cost-of-living clauses; 
* Individuals and families can use the data to compare their spending habits with those of similar types of households.

* The variation in clothing expenditure is reduced by 5.018% when income is considered.

* The variation in clothing expenditures is reduced by 5.018% when income is considered. Also, the coefficient of determination (0.05018) is not very close to 1, so the degree of linear association between income and clothing expenditures is not very large, meaning the points are not too close to the fitted regression line.

* The coefficient of determination is the ratio between the sum of squares regression and the total sum of squares. In this case, it was equal to 0.94982. This means that approximately 94.982% of the variation in Y can be explained by variation in X.

* because the coefficient of determination is very close to zero, there is a lot of variation found in clothing-expenditure

* The coefficient of determination value in this setting of 0.05018 tells us that around 5% of clothing expenditures are predictable.

* Since our Coefficient of determination is very close to zero, we know that there is a lot of variation in the y-values.

### 2.10: Considerations in Applying Regression Analysis

Be cautious whenever

1. making inferences about the future
	+ e.g., predicting future school enrollments based on school demographics
2. predicting `\(Y\)` based on an `\(X\)` value that itself is predicted
	+ e.g., predicting company sales based on demographic projections
3. extrapolating
	+ e.g., predicting sales based on disposable income levels that are outside the range of what has been seen previously
4. attempting to establish cause-and-effect
	+ e.g., just because cancer rates are predicted by smoking status `\((\beta_1 \neq 0)\)`, that doesn't mean that smoking causes cancer
5. estimating several things from the same data
	+ e.g., multiple testing or predicting the outcome for several new observations
6. `\(X\)` may be subject to measurement error
	+ see Chapter 4.

### CDI: Considerations in Regression Analyses

This data set provides selected county demographic information (CDI) for 440 of the most populous counties in the United States. 

Each line of the data set has an identification number with a county name and state abbreviation and provides information on 14 variables for a single county. 

Counties with missing data were deleted from the data set.

### Recap: Sections 2.8-2.10

After Sections 2.8-2.10, you should be able to 

* Describe the general linear test approach
* Calculate and interpret `\(R^2\)`
* Understand the limitations of `\(R^2\)`
* Describe the limitations of linear regression analysis	



---

### Learning Objectives for Sections 2.11

After Sections 2.11, you should be able to 

* Contrast regression and correlation
* Conduct and interpret inference on correlation coefficients
* Estimate, interpret, test, and contrast Spearman rank correlation.


---

### 2.11: Normal Correlation Models

So far, we have been assuming that the `\(X\)` values are known constants. 

* Confidence intervals, therefore, have been interpreted in terms of repeated sampling when the `\(X\)` values are kept the same.
* This might make sense when considering designed experiments. 
	
--

In observational studies, the `\(X\)` values cannot be controlled, so it might make more sense to think about the joint distribution of the two variables `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)` instead of trying to using one as the predictor ( `\(X\)`) and the other as the outcome ( `\(Y\)`)

* I.e., we might want to focus on **correlation**--understanding whether there is a relationship between two variables--rather than **regression**, where we try to predict one variable from the other

---

However, even in observational studies, the goal *is* often to predict one variable from others.
* To accomplish this, we can frame our regression as **conditional inference**.

--

Note that in observational studies, often the goal is actually to establish cause-and-effect relationships. This can be accomplished via regression *only if* a very precise set of additional assumptions are met. 


---

### Conditional Inferences

Your text describes how a bivariate normal distribution of `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)` implies that the *conditional* distribution of `\(Y_1 | Y_2\)` is a normal distribution. 

* Similarly, the conditional distribution of `\(Y_2|Y_1\)` is normal. 

--

This means that if we select `\((Y_1, Y_2)\)` from a bivariate normal distribution and wish to make conditional inferences about one conditional on the other (say, `\(Y_1|Y_2\)`), then our usual normal-error regression model is entirely applicable because 

1. The `\(Y_1\)` observations are independent.
2. The `\(Y_1\)` observations when `\(Y_2\)` is considered fixed are normally distributed with mean of the form `\(E[Y_1| Y_2] = \alpha_{1|2} + \beta_{1|2} Y_2\)` and constant variance `\(\sigma_{1|2}^2\)`. 

---

However, the result is more general than just the situation where the variables are jointly-normally distributed. 

If `\(Y\)` and `\(X\)` are random variables and

1. The conditional distributions of `\(Y_i\)`, given `\(X_i\)`,  are normal and independent, with conditional means `\(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i\)` and conditional variance `\(\sigma^2\)`, and
2. The `\(X_i\)` are independent random variables whose probability distribution `\(g(X_i)\)` does not involve parameters `\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma^2\)`,

then the regression model that we have been discussing is entirely valid;

* estimation, testing, and prediction work just as we have discussed despite `\(X\)` being a random variable. 

--

The only caveat is that our concept of sampling variability now involves repeated sampling of pairs `\((X_i, Y_i)\)` instead of repeated sampling of `\(Y_i\)` for fixed values of `\(X_i\)`. 

* (Note also that power depends on the distribution of `\(X\)`, which is not under our control in an observational study). 

---

### Pearson Correlation Coefficient

In a bivariate normal model, 

`\(f(Y_1, Y_2) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sqrt{1 - \rho_{12}^2}} \exp \left  \{ -\frac{1}{2 (1-\rho_{12}^2)} \left [ \left (\frac{Y_1 - \mu_1}{\sigma_1} \right)^2 - 2 \rho_{12} \left( \frac{Y_1 - \mu_1}{\sigma_1} \right) \left( \frac{Y_2 - \mu_2}{\sigma_2} \right) + \left( \frac{Y_2 - \mu_2}{\sigma_2} \right)^2 \right ] \right  \},\)`

the parameter `\(\rho_{12}\)` measures the association between the two variables `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)`. 

The maximum likelihood estimator of `\(\rho_{12}\)` is the *Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient*:
`$$\boxed{
r_{12} = \frac{\sum (Y_{i1} - \bar Y_1)(Y_{i2} - \bar Y_2)}{\sqrt{\sum (Y_{i1} - \bar Y_1)^2 \sum (Y_{i2} - \bar Y_2)^2}}.
}$$`

--

* Even if `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)` are not jointly-normally distributed, `\(r_{12}\)` provides information about the degree of linear relationship between the two variables.


---

* For simple linear regression of `\(Y_1|Y_2\)` or `\(Y_2|Y_1\)`, we can see that `\(R^2= r_{12}^2\)`

* More generally, `\(R^2\)` describes the variance explained by a *model* (which will usually involve multiple predictors), while `\(r_{12}^2\)` measures the linear relationship between two variables. 

`$$-1 \leq r_{12} \leq 1.$$`

* Values of `\(r_{12}\)` near 1 indicate strong positive linear association
* Values of `\(r_{12}\)` near -1 indicate strong negative linear association
* Values of `\(r_{12}\)` near 0 indicate no linear association

### Inferences on Correlation Coefficients

Consider testing 
`$$H_0: \rho_{12} = 0 \text{ vs } H_a: \rho_{12} \neq 0.$$`

This is testing whether there is a linear relationship between `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)`. 

This is equivalent to testing for a linear relationship when regressing `\(Y_1\)` on `\(Y_2\)`:
`$$H_0: \beta_{12} = 0 \text{ vs } H_a: \beta_{12} \neq 0.$$`

It is also equivalent to testing for a linear relationship when regressing `\(Y_2\)` on `\(Y_1\)`:
`$$H_0: \beta_{21} = 0 \text{ vs } H_a: \beta_{21} \neq 0.$$`

All of these tests can be written in terms of `\(\rho_{12}\)`:
`$$\boxed{
t^\ast = \frac{r_{12} \sqrt{n-2} } {1 - r_{12}^2}
},$$`
where `\(t^\ast\)` follows the `\(t(n-2)\)` distribution *only if* `\(H_0\)` is true.

### Interval Estimation of `\(\rho_{12}\)`

When `\(\rho_{12}\neq 0\)`, the sampling distribution of `\(r_{12}\)` is complicated. 

It is often much easier to think about the sampling distribution of the *Fisher `\(z\)` transformation* of `\(r_{12}\)`:
`$$\boxed{
z' = \frac{1}{2} \log\left(\frac{1 + r_{12}}{1-r_{12}} \right).
}$$`
*(Note that whenever I write `\(\log()\)`, I mean the natural logarithm `\(\log_e() = \ln()\)`. In `R`, for example, `\(log(10)=2.3025851\)`, while `\(log(exp(1)) = 1\)`.)*

When `\(n\)` is large (often `\(n \geq 25\)` suffices), this transformed Pearson correlation is approximately normal with mean 
`$$E[z'] = \zeta =  \frac{1}{2} \log\left(\frac{1 + \rho_{12}}{1-\rho_{12}} \right)$$`
and variance 
`$$\sigma^2 \{ z' \}  = \frac{1}{n-3}.$$`

---

An approximate `\(1-\alpha\)` confidence interval for `\(\zeta\)` is defined by
`$$\boxed{z' \pm z(1-\alpha/2) \sigma\{z' \}  },$$`
where `\(z(1-\alpha/2)\)` is the `\((1-\alpha/2)\cdot 100\)` percentile of the standard normal distribution. 

An approximate `\(1-\alpha\)` confidence interval for `\(\rho_{12}\)` is obtained by using the inverse of the Fisher z transformation:
`$$\rho_{12} = \frac{ \exp(2 z') -1 }{ \exp(2 z') + 1}.$$`

### SHS: Pearson Correlation


The Canadian Survey of Household Spending is carried out annually across Canada. 

(http://dli-idd-nesstar.statcan.gc.ca.proxy.library.upei.ca/webview/) 

The main purpose of the survey is to obtain detailed information about household spending. Information is also collected about dwelling characteristics as well as household equipment. 

The survey data are used by the following groups:

* Government departments use the data to help formulate policy; 
* Community groups, social agencies and consumer groups use the data to support their positions and to lobby governments for social changes; 
* Lawyers and their clients use the data to determine what is fair for child support and other compensation; 
* Labour and contract negotiators rely on the data when discussing wage and cost-of-living clauses; 
* Individuals and families can use the data to compare their spending habits with those of similar types of households.

### Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient

When `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)` differ considerably from the bivariate normal distribution, the Pearson correlation may be less useful:

* it will no longer be a complete description of the association, it will only be a measure of the linear relationship
* inference will no longer be exact, it will rely on the *central limit theorem* and, therefore, require large sample sizes

--

It might be possible to transform the variables to make them approximately bivariate normal, in which case we can proceed as we have discussed (as long as inference about the correlation of the transformed variables is really of interest). 


---

Another approach that we can take is to focus on the **Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient**:

`$$\boxed{
r_{s} = \frac{\sum (R_{i1} - \bar R_1)(R_{i2} - \bar R_2)}{\sqrt{\sum (R_{i1} - \bar R_1)^2 \sum (R_{i2} - \bar R_2)^2}},
}$$`
which is just the Pearson correlation coefficient, but with the actual values `\(Y_{ij}\)` replaced with their **ranks** `\(R_{ij}\)`

---

E..g, instead of using the actual values in the data set:



<div class="datatables html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-4bd1cb88212925a23fc2" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-4bd1cb88212925a23fc2">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10"],[0.91,0.9399999999999999,0.29,0.83,0.64,0.52,0.74,0.13,0.66,0.71],[0.75,0.83,0.02,0.57,0.26,0.14,0.41,0,0.29,0.36]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Y1<\/th>\n      <th>Y2<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"scrollX":true,"pageLength":20,"scrollY":150,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[1,2]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[10,20,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

we would use only the ranks (i.e., the ordering) of the data:

<div class="datatables html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-244f989f31387516b2fb" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-244f989f31387516b2fb">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10"],[9,10,2,8,4,3,7,1,5,6],[9,10,2,8,4,3,7,1,5,6]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Y1<\/th>\n      <th>Y2<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"scrollX":true,"pageLength":20,"scrollY":150,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[1,2]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[10,20,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

---

This means that the Spearman Correlation measures something slightly different than the Pearson Correlation: 

* Pearson Correlation measures the linear relationship
* Spearman Correlation measures a monotonic relationship 
	+ Spearman only looks at whether the *rank* in `\(Y_1\)` increases at the same rate as the *rank* in `\(Y_2\)`;
	+ i.e., it only looks for whether `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)` vary together, not whether they vary at a constant rate.

Consider the following data: 
&lt;img src="chapter2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-66-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

The Pearson Correlation is

```r
cor.test(Y1, Y2, method="pearson"); 
```

```
## 
## 	Pearson's product-moment correlation
## 
## data:  x and y
## t = 7.0334, df = 8, p-value = 0.000109
## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.7170162 0.9831174
## sample estimates:
##       cor 
## 0.9277897
```

The Pearson Correlation of the ranks is 


```r
cor.test(rank(Y1), rank(Y2), method="pearson"); 
```

```
## 
## 	Pearson's product-moment correlation
## 
## data:  x and y
## t = 134217728, df = 8, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  1 1
## sample estimates:
## cor 
##   1
```

---

Note that the Spearman Correlation is 


```r
cor.test(Y1, Y2, method="spearman"); 
```

```
## 
## 	Spearman's rank correlation rho
## 
## data:  x and y
## S = 3.6637e-14, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0
## sample estimates:

In addition, 

* Pearson Correlation is *highly sensitive to outliers*, while

### Inference using Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient

The Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient can be used to test

`\(H_0:\)` there is no association between `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)`  vs

`\(H_a:\)` there is an association between `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)`

or 

`\(H_a:\)` there is a positive (negative) association between `\(Y_1\)` and `\(Y_2\)`


This test is based on the same statistic we discussed earlier:

`$$\boxed{
t^\ast = \frac{r_{s} \sqrt{n-2} } {1 - r_{s}^2}
},$$`
and the same `\(t\)` distribution with `\(n-2\)` degrees of freedom.

&lt;!-- PUT SELECT WARM UP RESPONSES HEREHERE (preceded by a "&gt;"): --&gt;
&lt;!-- warm up question 2b) 4--&gt;

*  The Spearman rank correlation is larger than the Pearson correlation coefficient because one variable increases when the other increases, but not at a consistent amount.

* what I know about Pearson correlation is it evaluates linear relationships between 2 continuous variables. while spearman rank correlation evaluates the monotonic relationship between two continuous or ordinal variables.

* The Spearman correlation is just the Pearson correlation using the order statistics instead of the actual numeric values, thus Pearson correlation coefficient implies linear trend, and Spearman's shows monotonic trend. In the plot above, the curve is a better fit for our data, hence the smaller Pearson correlation coefficient.
