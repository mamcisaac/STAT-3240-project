### Learning Objectives for Sections 7.1-7.3

After Sections 7.1-7.3, you should be able to 

- Understand the concept of the extra sums of squares principle
- Conduct and interpret tests concerning regression coefficients using ESS principle 

---

### 7.1 Extra Sums of Squares

An **extra sum of squares** measures the marginal reduction in the error sum of squares when one or several predictor variables are added to the regression model, given that other predictor variables are already in the model. 

Equivalently, one can view an extra sum of squares as measuring the marginal increase in the regression sum of squares when one or several predictor variables are added to the regression model.

---

An extra sum of squares involves the difference between 

* the regression sum of squares for the regression model containing both the original `\(X\)` variable(s) and the new `\(X\)` variable(s) 
and 
* the regression sums of squares for the regression model containing the `\(X\)` variable(s) already in the model

E.g., if `\(X_1\)` is the "extra" variable:

`$$SSR(X_1| X_2) = SSR(X_1, X_2) - SSR(X_2)$$` 

If `\(X_2\)` is the "extra" variable:

`$$SSR(X_2| X_1) = SSR(X_1, X_2) - SSR(X_1)$$` 
---

### Decomposition of *SSR* into Extra Sums of Squares

Notice that we can decompose `\(SSR(X_1, X_2)\)` as 

`$$SSR(X_1, X_2) = SSR(X_1| X_2) + SSR(X_2)$$` 

or

`$$SSR(X_1, X_2) = SSR(X_2| X_1) +  SSR(X_1)$$` 
--

These get at different questions:

* How much variability in `\(Y\)` is explained by `\(X_2\)` alone? how much *additional* variability is explained by adding in `\(X_1\)`?

vs

* How much variability in `\(Y\)` is explained by `\(X_1\)` alone? how much *additional* variability is explained by adding in `\(X_2\)`?

---


Note that the `R` function `anova` provides *Sequential* or *Extra sums of squares* which reports how much variation is explained by the variable after accounting for everything that has *previously* been added to the model 

* (e.g., `\(SSR(X_1), SSR(X_2|X_1), SSR(X_3|X_1, X_2)\)`, etc ).

However, very similar looking functions (e.g., `Anova` or even the t-tests reported in the `summary` of `lm`) will commonly report *Adjusted* or *Type II sums of squares* that show how much variation is explained by the variable after accounting for everything else that *will be* added to the model 

* (e.g., `\(SSR(X_1| X_2, X_3)\)`, `\(SSR(X_2| X_1, X_3)\)`, `\(SSR(X_3| X_1, X_2)\)`).

### Test Whether All `\(\beta_k=0\)`

This is the *overall `\(F\)` test* of whether or not there is a regression relation between the response variable `\(Y\)` and the set of `\(X\)` variables:

`\(H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \ldots  = \beta_{p-1} =0\)`  

`\(H_a:\)` not all `\(\beta_k (k=1, \ldots, p-1)\)` equal `\(0\)`  

and the test statistic is:
`$$F^\ast = \frac{SSR(X_1, \ldots , X_{p-1})}{p-1} \div \frac{SSE(X_1, \ldots , X_{p-1})}{n-p} = \frac{MSR}{MSE}$$`

If `\(H_0\)` holds, `\(F^\ast \sim F(p - 1, n - p)\)`. Large values of `\(F^\ast\)` lead to conclusion `\(H_a\)`.

---
### Test Whether a Single `\(\beta_k=0\)`


This is a *partial `\(F\)` test* of whether a particular regression coefficient `\(\beta_k\)` equals `\(0\)`:

`\(H_0: \beta_k =0\)`  

`\(H_a: \beta_k \neq 0\)`  

and the test statistic is:
`$$\begin{align*} 
F^\ast &amp;= \frac{SSR(X_k | X_1, \ldots, X_{k-1}, X_{k+1}, \ldots, X_{p-1})}{1} \div \frac{SSE(X_1, \ldots , X_{p-1})}{n-p} \\
 &amp; = \frac{MSR(X_k | X_1, \ldots, X_{k-1}, X_{k+1}, \ldots, X_{p-1})}{MSE}
\end{align*}$$`

If `\(H_0\)` holds, `\(F^\ast \sim F(1, n - p)\)`. Large values of `\(F^\ast\)` lead to conclusion `\(H_a\)`.

--

An equivalent test statistic is 

`$$t^\ast = \frac{b_k}{s \{ b_k \}}$$`

---
### Test Whether Some `\(\beta_k=0\)`


This is another *partial `\(F\)` test*:

`\(H_0: \beta_q = \beta_{q+1} = \cdots = \beta_{p-1} =0\)`  

`\(H_a:\)` not all of these `\(\beta_k\)` equal `\(0\)`  
 

and the test statistic is:
`$$\begin{align*} 
F^\ast &amp;= \frac{SSR(X_q, \ldots, X_{p-1} | X_1, \ldots, X_{q-1})}{p-q} \div \frac{SSE(X_1, \ldots , X_{p-1})}{n-p} \\
 &amp; = \frac{MSR(X_q, \ldots, X_{p-1} | X_1, \ldots, X_{q-1})}{MSE}
\end{align*}$$`


If `\(H_0\)` holds, `\(F^\ast \sim F(p-q, n - p)\)`. Large values of `\(F^\ast\)` lead to conclusion `\(H_a\)`.

--

Notice that the previous two tests were just special cases of this one with `\(q=1\)` and `\(p-q=1\)`.

---

### Other Tests

These extra sums of squares tests - where we are testing whether one or several `\(\beta_k\)` is equal to 0 - are special cases of the general linear test appraoch. 

However, we can answer an even broader range of questions using the general linear test approach. 

Consider testing whether `\(\beta_1= \beta_2\)` in the full model

`$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \beta_3 X_{i3} + \varepsilon_i$$`

This is equivalent to testing the adequacy of the reduced model
`$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (X_{i1} + X_{i2}) + \beta_3 X_{i3} + \varepsilon_i$$`

which we can accomplish using the general `\(F^\ast\)` test statistic (2.70) with `\(1\)` and `\(n-4\)` degrees of freedom. 

---

Similarly, we might want to test whether `\(\beta_1=3\)` and `\(\beta_3=5\)` in the full model

`$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \beta_3 X_{i3} + \varepsilon_i$$`
which could be tested by testing the adequacy of the reduced model
`$$Y_i - 3 X_{i1} - 5 X_{i3}= \beta_0 + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \varepsilon_i$$`
using the general linear test statistic `\(F^\ast\)` with `\(2\)` and `\(n-4\)` degrees of freedom.

### Recap: Sections 7.1-7.3

After Sections 7.1-7.3, you should be able to 

- Understand the concept of the extra sums of squares principle
- Conduct and interpret tests concerning regression coefficients using ESS principle 

---


### Learning Objectives for Sections 7.4, 7.6

After Sections 7.4 and 7.6, you should be able to 

- Compute and interpret coefficients of partial determination
- Understand multicollinearity and its effects

---

### 7.4: Coefficients of Partial Determination

Recall that the *coefficient of multiple determination*, `\(R^2\)`, measures the proportionate reduction in the variation of `\(Y\)` achieved by the introduction of the entire set of `\(X\)` variables considered in the model. 

A *coefficient of partial determination*, in contrast, measures the marginal contribution of one `\(X\)` variable when all others are already included in the model.

For example, the coefficient of partial determination between `\(Y\)` and `\(X_2\)`, given that `\(X_1\)` is in the model is 

`$$R^2_{Y 2 | 1	} = \frac{ SSR(X_2| X_1) }{SSE(X_1)}$$` 

--

That is, the coefficient of partial determination is the percent of variation that cannot be explained in the reduced model, but can be explained by the predictors specified in a fuller model. 

---

Coefficients of partial determination can take on values between `\(0\)` and `\(1\)`

The coefficient of partial dertermination `\(R_{Y 1|2}\)` measures the relation between `\(Y\)` and `\(X_1\)` when both of these variables
have been adjusted for their linear relationships to `\(X_2\)`. 

I.e., a coefficient of partial determination can be interpreted as a coefficient of simple determination of these residuals 

---


Consider a multiple regression model with two `\(X\)` variables. Suppose we regress `\(Y\)` on `\(X_2\)` and obtain the residuals:
`$$e(Y|X_2) = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i(X_2)$$`
where `\(\hat{Y}_i(X_2)\)` denotes the fitted values of `\(Y\)` when `\(X_2\)` is in the model.  

Suppose we further regress `\(X_1\)` on `\(X_2\)` and obtain the residuals:
`$$e(X_1|X_2) = X_{i1} - \hat{X}_{i1}(X_2)$$`
where `\(\hat{X}_{i1}(X_2)\)` denotes the fitted values of `\(X_1\)` 	in the regression of `\(X_1\)` on `\(X_2\)`.  

The coefficient of simple determination `\(R^2\)` between these two sets of residuals equals the coefficient of partial determination `\(R_{Y 1 | 2}\)`

--

* The plot of the residuals `\(e(Y|X_2)\)` against `\(e(X_1|X_2)\)` provides a graphical representation of the strength of the relationship between `\(Y\)` and `\(X_1\)`, adjusted for `\(X_2\)`. Such plots of residuals, called added variable plots or partial regression plots, are discussed in Section 10.1.

### Coefficients of Partial Correlation

The square root of a coefficient of partial determination is called a **coefficient of partial correlation.**

It is given the same sign as that of the corresponding regression coefficient in the fitted regression function. 

Coefficients of partial correlation are frequently used in practice, although they do not have as clear a meaning as coefficients of partial determination. 

One use of partial correlation coefficients is in computer routines for finding the best predictor variable to be selected next for inclusion in the regression model. We discuss this use in Chapter 9.

### 7.6: Multicollinearity and Its Effects


When the predictor variables are correlated among themselves, *intercorrelation* or *multi-collinearity* among them is said to exist. 

* **multi-collinearity** generally refers to situations where the correlation among the predictor variables is very high.

### Need for More Powerful Diagnostics for Multicollinearity

As we have seen, multicollinearity among the predictor variables can have important consequences for interpreting and using a fitted regression model. 

The diagnostic tool considered here for identifying multicollinearity - namely, the pairwise coefficients of simple correlation between the predictor variables - is frequently helpful. 

Often, however, serious multicollinearity exists without being disclosed by the pairwise correlation coefficients. 

In Chapter 10, we present a more powerful tool for identifying the existence of serious multicollinearity. Some remedial measures for lessening the effects of multicollinearity will be considered in Chapter 11.
